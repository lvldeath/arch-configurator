# S.A.C.C. - Simple Arch Concise Configurator
Bash script that runs through basic faculties of Arch for a quicker configure process.

# What or who is this script for?
This guide is for POST-INSTALLATION of Arch. Meaning after you've installed and updated `pacman` and done `arch-chroot /mnt`.
If you're doing this to avoid going through the configuration process, I would encourage you to not use this tool. It is important to know not only the installation but also the configuration processes of Arch so that you know what this script is doing. 
This script is aimed at people who know how to install Arch and the software they want, so that it's faster than doing it by hand.
